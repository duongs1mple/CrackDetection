# CrackDetection
#my_model_250_3 & my_model_250_4 are learned weights received after training model 1 and 2
#Model 1 identifies images with/without cracks
#Model 2 classify images with cracks into 3 types of cracks : Small , Large , Serious
#load_tf.m to import the pretrained weights / model to Matlab
#inference.m to make the model execute the prediction on Matlab
